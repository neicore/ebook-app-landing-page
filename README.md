# Ebook App Landing Page
In this project, I have built a landing page concept for an Ebook app. I used this [UI design from dribble](https://dribbble.com/shots/14191173-Download-Ebooks-Landing-page-design?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=hadialtaf&utm_content=Download%20Ebooks%20Landing%20page%20design&utm_medium=Social_Share&utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=hadialtaf&utm_content=Download%20Ebooks%20Landing%20page%20design&utm_medium=Social_Share). I changed the design a little bit by using different images, fonts, colors, and adding mobile responsiveness.
